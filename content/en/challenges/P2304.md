## Program Description

Run Linux distribution with GNOME/KDE desktops, OpenGL 3D benchmarks, video playback, and 2D/3D games on a combination of SG2042/Pioneer Box + an arbitrary (host sanctioned) Chinese domestic GPU.

**Note: The host specifies that the first two to complete porting will receive the specified reward.**

## Rubrics

1. Runs the specified applications for six hours without crashing.
2. Runs glmark or glmark-es2.
3. Runs glxinfo (on GPUs with OpenGL support).
4. Runs SuperTuxKart without crashing.
5. (Extra Credit) Runs any map in SuperTuxKart at any settings with a framerate of 60fps.

**Assessment Platform: SG2042**
