## Program Description

It is a feat to get Baby LLaMA 2 running on small development boards like the Milk-V Duo. This program aims to improve Baby LLaMA 2 performance on Milk-V Duo, as assessed by tokens processed per second. The participant will make use of lightweight techniques and compiler optimization principles to develop a story-telling robot with support for microphone and command-line input. The demo should output robotic voice via speakers.

## Rubrics

1. Submissions will be evaluated based on both accuracy and performance, each submission will be given the same input and assessed based on reference testsuites for accuracy and performance.
2. Accuracy will be assessed based on a delta difference between submitted output and reference output, evaluating the application of optimization techniques and their effect on the accuracy of model inference. Performance will be assessed based on the number of tokens processed per second.
3. Time elapsed during Text-to-Speech (TTS) computation.
4. The host will assess both accuracy and performance and assign scores to each submission based on a predetermined weighted scale. The highest scoring submission wins.

**Assessment Platform: Duo**
