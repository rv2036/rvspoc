## Challenge Description

Current AMD Zen-series CPUs (e.g., EPYC 9004 series) have begun integrating RISC-V coprocessors for specific acceleration tasks. The microcode of AMD Zen-series processors enables modification of low-level CPU instruction execution behavior through software-level firmware patches, making it suitable for optimizing instruction execution and altering specific instruction behaviors. [Zentool](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/entrysign/zentool), developed by Google's Security Research team, is a toolkit for analyzing, modifying, and generating microcode patches for AMD Zen-series processors.

## Rubrics

1. **Microcode Patch**: Complete microcode modifications for Zen-series CPUs to enable direct execution of RISC-V binary programs. If direct execution is not feasible, optimize the modified microcode to achieve a significant level of acceleration for RISC-V binaries.
2. **Performance Optimization Testing**: Run RISC-V binary versions of benchmark applications (e.g., Coremark, Dhrystone) on Zen-series CPUs. Compare performance against simulator-based RISC-V emulation on the same hardware, ensuring measurable and substantial performance improvements.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the rationale behind microcode modifications.
   - Outline methodologies for accelerating RISC-V binaries.
   - Detail testing procedures and benchmark results.

**Important Notes**  
- Ensure compliance with open-source licenses and copyright regulations.
- Participants must prepare their own development environment with required tools/libraries.

## Platform

- AMD Zen-series CPUs

## Assessment

- Details will be announced by the RVSPOC Organizing Committee after June 7.
- Due to the open-ended nature of the challenge and the complexity of the software, there may be unexplained or incomplete aspects in the initial release. Adjustments may be made based on participant feedback during the competition. Please monitor the official event website for updates. Final interpretations and decisions rest with the competition's Problem Review Committee.

## Notice on Intellectual Properties and Open Source Licenses

All challenge submissions must be open source and committed to a specified repository. The participant(s) (author) holds rights to their work. The host encourages contributing any changes made to the upstream.
