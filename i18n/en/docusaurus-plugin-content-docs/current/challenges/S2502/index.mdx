## Challenge Description

Current AMD Zen-series CPUs (e.g., EPYC 9004 series) have begun integrating RISC-V coprocessors for specific acceleration tasks. The microcode of AMD Zen-series processors enables modification of low-level CPU instruction execution behavior through software-level firmware patches, making it suitable for optimizing instruction execution and altering specific instruction behaviors. [Zentool](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/entrysign/zentool), developed by Google's Security Research team, is a toolkit for analyzing, modifying, and generating microcode patches for AMD Zen-series processors.

## Rubrics

1. **Microcode Modification**: Implement microcode modifications for Zen-series CPUs to execute/accelerate RISC-V binaries.
2. **Functional Testing**: Run Dhrystone benchmarks from the submission repository on Zen-series CPUs.
3. **Documentation**: Document:
   - Microcode modification methodology
   - RISC-V binary acceleration approach
   - Dhrystone testing procedures
   - Test results

**Important Notes**  
- Ensure compliance with open-source licenses and copyright regulations.
- Participants must prepare their own development environment with required tools/libraries.

## Platform

- AMD Zen-series CPUs

## Submission

import Req from '../_requirements-for-porting.mdx';

<Req submissionRepoUrl="https://github.com/rv2036/rvspoc-P2501-v4l2" deadline="2025 年 6 月 7 日 (AoE)" />

## Assessment

- Details will be announced by the RVSPOC Organizing Committee after June 7.
- Due to the open-ended nature of the challenge and the complexity of the software, there may be unexplained or incomplete aspects in the initial release. Adjustments may be made based on participant feedback during the competition. Please monitor the official event website for updates. Final interpretations and decisions rest with the competition's Problem Review Committee.

## Notice on Intellectual Properties and Open Source Licenses

All challenge submissions must be open source and committed to a specified repository. The participant(s) (author) holds rights to their work. The host encourages contributing any changes made to the upstream.
