import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

1. The submission repository is  <Link href={props.submissionRepoUrl}>{props.submissionRepoUrl}</Link>
2. Submit your results as a Pull Request to the repository above.
   - All references to "PR" in the following conditions refer to a Pull Request linked to the repository specified in Condition 1.
3. When creating the PR, include all necessary materials to reproduce your porting and optimizations, such as:
   - **Complete source code or binary files** \*
   - Configuration files (if applicable)
   - Additional library files (if applicable)
   - Patches (if applicable)
   - Any other content required for validating the submission.
4. Include a detailed explanation file with the following information for verifying your optimizations:
   - Whether the validation is platform-specific. If yes, specify the OS name, version, and installation instructions.
   - Whether specific dependency libraries are required. If yes, list their details and installation steps.
   - Program compilation and installation steps.
   - Program execution steps.
   - Program execution results.
   - Any other information necessary for validating the submission.
5. Optimization Challenge Rules:
   - For the first item in Condition 3 \*, If a participant submits only binary files (hereafter "binaries") for validation before the competition deadline,
     **they must later submit complete source code via PR to finalize the submission.**
     1. The submitted source code must 100% match the code used to generate the binaries.**
     2. Content submitted after the competition deadline will not affect scoring but will only verify consistency with the binaries.
6. The organizing committee will begin validating submissions after the competition ends (i.e., after {props.deadline}). PRs created after this date will not contribute to the competition score.
